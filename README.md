# Recruiting process task for Data Analyst Intern at Global App Testing.

## The task content

You are facing the new task: yours new PM asked you for help in calculating and visualizing the new KPI, that will
help in process of providing results for the client.

The KPI definition is: amount of accepted errors per an hour in first 6 hours since starting the testing cycle. PM told
you that for sake of simplicity you can assume that cycle starts with the first reported error.

If you will be able to show that metric, PM will appreciate analysis of the data, because he has no time for it.

Create the view that will show the given metric and suggest another charts that will be helpful for PM.

File that you have to analyze: cycle_data.csv

## Running my solution 

To run the script that will generate an answer for this task, just simply execute the `__main__.py` script. 

After that, follow the instructions and proceed to `./outcomes` folder, where you will be able to read analysis.

The script was written with use of Python 3.9, and some libraries specified in `requirements.txt`.


## The steps

In order to analise the given data I have taken the following steps:

- Handling I/O operations

- Data cleaning

- Selecting

- Printing the solution

For each step I have written scripts exclusively for this task. After all hard work, I realized that it wasn't necessary - 
for example I should have used Pandas for cleaning and selecting the data, and I could possibly use some SQL database 
instead of the .csv files.
